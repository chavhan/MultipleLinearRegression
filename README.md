File Structure:
readme.txt
50_startups
analysis_50_startup
50_startups prediction
Toyota Corolla
ToyotaCorolla Dataset prediction Model
toyota_analysis

Development Environment:
My script was developed RStudio Version 1.3.1056

Usage:
Install RStudio. Open file in RStudio and change the code according to you dataset for various situations and run it.


File Description 
50_startups- Script file in R language 
Toyota Corolla- Script file in R language 
50_startups prediction - Report file which demonstrate my approach towards result for 50 start up dataset 
ToyotaCorolla Dataset prediction Model - Report file which demonstrate my approach towards result for ToyotaCorolla dataset 
analysis_50_startup - This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on 50 start up dataset
toyota_analysis - This file contains the different outcome of r function to observe the output and act accordingly on ToyotaCorolla dataset 

objective:- 
1) ToyotaCorolla dataset -> Consider only the below columns and prepare a prediction model for predicting Price.
2) for 50 start up dataset -> Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.

Note :- I have added some png files which are the different graphs on both the datasets for EDA and result observation purpose. Also added the snapshot of both the datasets.
